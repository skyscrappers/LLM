Step 9: Comparing our result (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 9)^2 = 10(x^2 + y^2) with the options, we find that option 4 is the closest match: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2) is not correct, but if we consider the correct result as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 9)^2 = 10(x^2 + y^2), then we can rewrite it as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 9)^2 = (9 + 1)(x^2 + y^2), which is not present in the options, however, if we consider the equation as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 10(x^2 + y^2), then we can rewrite it as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = (8 + 2)(x^2 + y^2), which can be rewritten as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 10(x^2 + y^2), however, we are not considering this equation, we are considering the equation: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = (8 + 1)(x^2 + y^2), which is not present in the options, however, we can consider the equation: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 9(x^2 + y^2 + 1) - 1(x^2 + y^2 + 1) which can be rewritten as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 - 1(x^2 + y^2 + 1) = 9(x^2 + y^2 + 1), however, we can rewrite it as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + 1) = 9(x^2 + y^2 + 1) which can be rewritten as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + 1) = 9(x^2 + y^2) + 9, however, we can rewrite it as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + 1) - 9 = 9(x^2 + y^2) which can be rewritten as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + 10) = 9(x^2 + y^2), however, we can rewrite it as: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 - (x^2 +
