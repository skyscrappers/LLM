Output: option 2
Output: option 3
So, the closest point to the origin on the plane is (3/7
Output: option 2
But please note that this option is incorrect based on the calculation. The correct answer is not listed among the options provided.
So, the correct output is: option 3.
Output: None of the options match the correct equation. The correct equation is x^2 + (y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1.
The correct option is option 1: y = 2x + 1.
Output: option 1.
So the output is option 3.
Since this option is not listed, the question might be misleading or incorrect as it stands. If we strictly follow the options given, none of them correctly describe the situation.
So, the output is option 2.
Output: None of the options 1, 2, 3, 4.
option 4: 8

Output: option 4.
option 1: True, True
The correct option is option 2: π/6.
Output: option 4
Output: option 3
Output: option 3
Output: option 2

option 4: 7
option 3: 0 and 1 only
So, the correct option is option 4: 3π/2.
Note: The problem might be missing additional information or there might be a mistake in the options provided. Please double-check the problem statement and the options. If there's an error, please provide the correct information for a more accurate solution.
This is because we have established that there is either one or no positive real roots, and since we can't have a negative number of roots, the most plausible scenario is that there is exactly one real root, with the remaining four roots being complex conjugates.

Output: option 4: Wednesday
Since none of the given options match this result, there might be an error in the options provided. The correct answer is option 1: −9/π cm/min.
This is the false statement because the system is actually inconsistent, as shown by the last row of the matrix.
So, the correct option is option 4: f(log c).
Output: None of the above (not provided in the options).
So, none of the options match the correct answer.
Output: option 1
Output: option 4: False, False
option 3: 0
Output: option 2.
Thus, the output is option 1.

Therefore, the correct option is option 2: 30.
Output: option 1.
Output: option 2.
The correct option is option 2: saddle point at P and at Q. The output is option 2.
Output: None of the options is necessarily true.
option 1, as it is the most specific condition and is not equivalent to the other four conditions, which are more general and encompassing.
Note: To be more precise, we would need to solve the equation numerically or graphically, but given the options, option 1 is the most reasonable choice.
Output: option 2
Output: option 1
The correct answer is not listed. However, if we consider the closest option, it would be option 2: -1. But please note that this is not the accurate result based on the calculations.
However, it is important to note that the question as posed does not allow for a completely correct answer. The given options do not align with the properties of the function f as described. If this is a question from an actual test or quiz, it might be flawed or might require a more nuanced understanding of the concepts involved.
3/8 = 0.37
Output: None of the given options is correct. The correct probability is 1/3.
However, there seems to be a mistake in the options provided. The correct answer should be a multiple of 20i, not 32i. The closest option to the correct answer is option 4, but it is not accurate. The correct answer is not listed among the options.
Output: option 3
option 2: open
Output: option 1
Output: None of the options are correct.
So, T(2, 1) maps to the point (3, 0). None of the given options match this result. There might be a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided. However, based on the given information and calculations, none of the options is correct.
