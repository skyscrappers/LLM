Option 1 (True, False)
Final Answer: Option 3: π/3
Final Answer: Option 2
Final Answer: Option 2: Only (IV) is not a valid interval of convergence for a power series. The correct answer is not among the given options. The valid intervals of convergence for a power series would be in the form of (a, b] or [a, b), where a and b are real numbers, and the series converges for all x within that interval. The correct answer is not provided in the options.
Observation: Both options 2 and 3 must be true for all Lebesgue integrable functions, as they both rely on the fact that the set of points where a Lebesgue integrable function is nondifferentiable is always
Final Answer: Option 1. The graph of x^(log y) = y^(log x) is the open first quadrant.
Final Answer: The p-norm is expressable as an inner product when p equals 2. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2.

Final Answer: Option 4
Final Answer: Option 1: 0
(Note: The final answer provided in the format requested is Option 4, but based on the observations, all three options I, II, and III are correct. The discrepancy might be due to a misinterpretation of the question or a mistake in the final answer format. The correct interpretation should be that all options I, II, and III are ideals of R, but if we have to choose one option, it would be Option 4 as per the given format.)
(Note: The discrepancy here suggests there might be an error in the setup of the problem or the calculation. It's crucial to double-check the work to ensure the correct answer is chosen from the provided options.)
Final Answer: Option [day corresponding to remainder X]. For example, if remainder X corresponds to Sunday, the final answer would be "Final Answer: Option 1 (Sunday)".
dh/dt ≈ -4/(3π
Observation: Since the particular solution is (0, 0, 0, 0), every solution can indeed be expressed as a scalar multiple of it
Final Answer: Option 3
Final Answer: The correct option is Option 2: II only, as the determinant of A is -3, while the trace is -1. The other properties mentioned in the options (I and III) cannot be confirmed with the given information.
Observation: After re-evaluating, I get y = 2e^2 - 
Final Answer: Option 3: 51 <= H <= 55 has the greatest probability.
Final Answer: The correct option is Option 3. Statement 1 is false because a local maximum does not necessarily mean that the derivative is equal to zero (it must be zero, but not all local maxima have this property). Statement 2 is true because there cannot exist non-constant continuous maps from R to Q.
